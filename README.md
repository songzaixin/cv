# My Brief Introduction

I have become a research fellow on ***electric machine*** since 2016. I received the B.Eng. and M.Eng. degrees in electrical engineering and automation from Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), Harbin, China, in 2016 and 2018, respectively. I received the Ph.D. degree in School of Energy and Environment from City University of Hong Kong in 2021. I have been working on electric machine for years. Currently, I work as a ***Postdoctoral Fellow*** in City University of Hong Kong. 

My research interests cover the design, analysis, optimization, and control of emerging permanent magnet machines particularly the high-speed machines and multi-phase machines, propulsion motors for automotive and aerospace applications, multi-physics modeling, simulation, and tests.
